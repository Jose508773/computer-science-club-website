                    The Computer Science Club welcomes everyone with a curiosity for the field and a passion for 
                    learning. Since its founding, the club has been a cornerstone for students to connect, grow, 
                    and share knowledge. Over the years, it has fostered a vibrant community dedicated to exploring 
                    computer science and supporting one another on their journeys. Our mission is to inspire and 
                    empower individuals to develop skills, discover opportunities, and contribute to the ever-evolving 
                    world of technology.

                    Our club hosts bi-weekly meetings filled with engaging activities that dive into various 
                    computer science-related topics. We also organize local field trips, such as a visit to the 
                    Fab Lab, where members learn to create and 3D print models, gaining hands-on experience with 
                    cutting-edge technology.

                    Additionally, we host workshops and invite special guests to share their experiences, insights, 
                    and opportunities in the field. These events provide a unique chance to learn from professionals 
                    and explore pathways within computer science.

                    Last semester, our club had the honor of collaborating with a computer science professor for a 
                    resume workshop. During the session, students received personalized feedback on their resumes, 
                    helping them strengthen their applications for internships and job opportunities.
